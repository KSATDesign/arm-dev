# nethserver-arm-dev

This is the [issue tracker] (https://github.com/markVnl/nethserver-arm-dev/issues) for groundwork of porting [Nethserver 7] (https://github.com/NethServer) to armhfp and aarch64.

Development is focused on the core functionally of Nethserver, this includes the packages:
* nethserver-base
* nethserver-lib
* nethserver-firewall-base
* nethserver-ssh
* nethserver-httpd-admin

The proposed use of this issue tacker is limited to this groundwork.

If you want to have a look at it, [install] (http://wiki.nethserver.org/doku.php?id=ns_raspi2) it on your raspberry  PI
(keep in mind this are the first baby steps of the port to arm)
