# nethpi-dev

This is the [issue tracker] (https://github.com/markVnl/nethpi-dev/issues) for groundwork of porting [Nethserver 7] (https://github.com/NethServer) to arm.

Development is focused on the core functionally of Nethserver, this includes the packages:
* nethserver-base
* nethserver-lib
* nethserver-firewall-base
* nethserver-ssh
* nethserver-httpd-admin

The proposed use of this issue tacker is limited to this groundwork.
